# GUI Configuration
#
# Conditional Operators Guide:
# This plugin supports conditional expressions in text using these formats:
#
# STANDARD CONDITIONALS: %[(condition)text]%
#    - Shows 'text' if condition is true, otherwise shows nothing
#    - Used for: pagination, optional elements
#
# TERNARY CONDITIONALS: %[(condition)true_text ~: false_text]%
#    - Shows 'true_text' if condition is true, otherwise shows 'false_text'
#    - Uses ~: as separator to avoid conflicts with colons in text
#    - Used for: status indicators, type switching
#
# EXAMPLES FROM THIS CONFIG:
#   Pagination: "%[(max_pages > 1)&cPage&8: &6%page% &8/ &7%max_pages%]%"
#   Crafting status: "%[(isCraftable == true)&8[&2&l✔&8] ~: &8[&c&l❌&8]]%"
#   Enable/disable: "%[(isCraftable == true)disable ~: enable]%"
#   Type switching: "%[(type == DEFAULT)FILTERED ~: DEFAULT]%"
#
# OPERATORS USED IN THIS CONFIG:
#   >  (greater than)     Example: max_pages > 1
#   == (equals)           Example: isCraftable == true, type == DEFAULT
